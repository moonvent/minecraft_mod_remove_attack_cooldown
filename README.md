## README (Some interested advices)

You can configurate the mod, exactly if you want to add a little balance (for example reduce a fast attack for axes, cause in vanila axes a little stronger then swords, and it can be less comfortable)

`your_minecraft_folder/config/remove_attack_cooldown.cfg`

and you can with OPENED minecraft change the config, re-enter in the world (if you change it in the world) and see, that's you changes is apply! It's so comfortable feature for configure mod (and for tests exactly :-) ), and you can play with some settings without reload a full minecraft.

## Little offtop about mod

After 5 year of not playing in minecraft, I return to it and understand that official developers make some global updates but all this updates not interested for me :( And one update with cooldown of attack I exactly didn't like. And because of that, I create this mod.
